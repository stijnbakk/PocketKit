<Steps>

1. **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/stijnbakk/PocketKit.git
    ```

2. **Add Pocketbase**
    
    Download [latest Pocketbase releas](https://github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/releases) for your machine.
    Place the `pocketbase` binary inside `./server`

3. **Initiate pocketbase**
    
    From root of the repository run:
    ```bash
    yarn && yarn dev:server
    ```
    This will start the Pocketbase server on port `8090`.

    Open the pocketbase admin panel [`http://localhost:8090/_`](http://localhost:8090/_) and register an admin account

    Close the pocketbase server with `ctrl+c`

4. **Setup necessary environment variables**

    Before running the app, we need to set the following environment variables:
    ```text
    #.env
    PUBLIC_POCKETBASE_URL=http://localhost:8090
    ```
5. **Install dependencies and start project**
    Install dependencies with your package manager of choice
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

    Run the app with

    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```

    This command will spinup both app and server.

    - App: [`http://localhost:5173`](http://localhost:5173)
    - Server: [`http://localhost:8090`](http://localhost:8090)

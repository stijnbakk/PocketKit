To be added

Deployment can be done for free. For this we deploy fly.io for the backend, and Vercel for deploying the frontend.

## Deploying the backend
This guide requires you to install the [flyctl](https://fly.io/docs/hands-on/install-flyctl/) CLI, and create a _free_ account with fly using `fly auth signup` (or `fly auth login` if you already have an account).

<Steps>

1. **Setup fly CLI and account**

    Install the fly CLI with

    <Tabs>
      <TabItem label="MacOS" >
        
        ```bash
        brew install flyctl
        ``` 

        or

        ```bash
        curl -L https://fly.io/install.sh | sh
        ```

      </TabItem>
      <TabItem label="Linux" >
        
        ```bash
        curl -L https://fly.io/install.sh | sh
        ```

      </TabItem>
      <TabItem label="Windows" >

        ```bash
        pwsh -Command "iwr https://fly.io/install.ps1 -useb | iex"
        ```
        </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

    <small>Reference: [fly CLI installation guide](https://fly.io/docs/flyctl/install/)</small>

    From there create a _free_ account with fly using `fly auth signup` (or `fly auth login` if you already have an account).
    ```bash
    flyctl auth signup
    ```

2. **Setup the `fly.toml` file**

    Inside `./server` sits a `fly.toml` file that has setup pocketbase for deployment to fly.

    Change the app name to your application name.
    ```toml {1-2}
    # server/fly.toml
    app = 'pocketbase-server' # change this to your application name
    primary_region = 'ams'

    [build]

    [[mounts]]
      source = 'pb_data'
      destination = '/pb/pb_data'

    [http_service]
      internal_port = 8080
      force_https = true
      auto_stop_machines = 'stop'
      auto_start_machines = true
      min_machines_running = 0
      processes = ['app']

    [[vm]]
      memory = '1gb'
      cpu_kind = 'shared'
      cpus = 1
    ```

3. **Setup the inital fly.io deployment**

    Navigate to the server directory and run `fly launch` for initial deployment.
    ```bash
    cd ./server && fly launch
    ```

    This will run you through the fly setup process. After which the app will be deployed on fly.io.

4. **Register an admin account**

    Retrieve the URL of your server deployment, add `/_` to the end of the URL, and navigate there to setup an admin account.
</Steps>

## Frontend deployment
The easiest way to deploy the frontend is to upload the app to github or gitlab, and point Vercel to the repository. It will automatically deploy any updates you push to the repository.

<Steps>

1. **Setup Github and repository**

    Create a new repository on Github or Gitlab, link your local repository to the remote repository, and push the code to the repository.

2. **Setup Vercel**

    Create a _free_ account with Vercel, and create a new project.
    Point the project to the repository you created in step 1. 
    Setup the environment variables in vercel, using the fly.io URL for pocketbase:
    ```
    PUBLIC_POCKETBASE_URL=https://<your-fly-app-name>.fly.dev
    ```

3. **Click deploy**
</Steps>
Any updates pushed to the repository will automatically be deployed to Vercel.



## CI/CD
If you deploy the frontend with Vercel, deployments for the frontend are automatically handled

Backend deployments can also be handled automatically with Github Actions.

<Steps>
1. **Uncomment the code in `.github/workflows/fly.yml`**

    ``` yaml
    name: Fly Deploy

    on:
      push:
        branches:
          - main
          - feat/checkout

    env:
      FLY_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.FLY_API_TOKEN }}

    jobs:
      deploy:
        name: Deploy to Fly.io
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest

        steps:
          - name: Checkout
            uses: actions/checkout@v4
            with:
              fetch-depth: 2 # Fetch at least the last two commits

          - name: Check for changes in /server directory
            id: check_changes
            run: |
              CHANGED_FILES=$(git diff --name-only ${{ github.event.before }} ${{ github.sha }} | grep '^server/' || true)
              if [ -z "$CHANGED_FILES" ]; then
                echo "No changes in /server directory or its subdirectories."
                echo "no_changes=true" >> $GITHUB_ENV
              else
                echo "Changes detected in /server directory or its subdirectories."
                echo "$CHANGED_FILES"
                echo "no_changes=false" >> $GITHUB_ENV
              fi

          - name: Exit if no changes in /server
            if: env.no_changes == 'true'
            run: |
              echo "Success, no files in /server changed, no need to redeploy Fly.io."
              exit 0

          - name: Change to server directory
            if: env.no_changes == 'false'
            run: cd server && ls -la # Navigate to the 'server' directory and list files to confirm

          - name: Setup flyctl
            if: env.no_changes == 'false'
            uses: superfly/flyctl-actions/setup-flyctl@master

          - name: Deploy
            if: env.no_changes == 'false'
            run: |
              cd server
              flyctl deploy --remote-only -a pocketbase-server
    ```


2. **Update the application name**

    Update the application name in the `fly.toml` file to the name of your application.

    ```yaml showLineNumbers startLineNumber=50 {5}
    - name: Deploy
      if: env.no_changes == 'false'
      run: |
        cd server
        flyctl deploy --remote-only -a pocketbase-server
    ```

3. **Setup Github Actions secrets**

    Before pushing the workflow to Github, we need to setup the secrets for the Github Actions.

    In terminal, navigate to `./server` and retrieve a Fly API token:
    ```bash
    cd ./server && flyctl tokens create deploy -x 999999h
    ```
    Copy the token.

    In Github, navigate to your repository, and go to `Settings -> Secrets and variables -> Actions -> New repository secret`.

    Name your secret `FLY_API_TOKEN`, and paste the token you copied in the value field.



4. **Commit and push the changes to Github**
  Under `Actions` you should now be seeing a `Fly Deploy` workflow.

</Steps>

The `Fly Deploy` workflow will only run when there are changes in the `/server` directory. If not, it will skip the action. This saves you a lot of unnecessary build minutes when you're not pushing any changes to the backend.

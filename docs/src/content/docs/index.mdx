## What is PocketKit?

PocketKit is a complete boilerplate for building full-stack applications with your choice of **SvelteKit** or **Next.js** (frontend) and **PocketBase** (backend). It includes everything you need to start building:

- **Authentication ready** - Login, register, and session management configured
- **Free deployment** - Frontend on Vercel, backend on Fly.io
- **Automatic deployment** - Push to GitHub and deploy automatically
- **Local development** - Single command to run both frontend and backend
- **TypeScript** - Fully typed with SvelteKit and PocketBase SDKs

## Quick Start

Get started in 60 seconds:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/stijnbakk/PocketKit.git
cd PocketKit

# 2. Run the get started script (auto-installs everything)
./GET-STARTED.sh
# Choose between SvelteKit or React/Next.js

# 3. Start coding
cd app-svelte  # or app-react
npm run dev    # or: yarn dev / pnpm dev
```

The script automatically:
- Lets you choose between SvelteKit or React/Next.js
- Initializes a fresh git repository
- Installs dependencies (using pnpm/yarn/npm)
- Downloads PocketBase for your OS
- Creates your initial commit

**Access your app:**
- SvelteKit: `http://localhost:5173` (frontend) + `http://localhost:8090/_` (backend admin)
- Next.js: `http://localhost:3000` (frontend) + `http://localhost:8090/_` (backend admin)

## Why PocketKit?

Building full-stack apps requires setting up authentication, databases, deployment pipelines, and more. PocketKit handles all of this so you can focus on building your product:

- **No backend code needed** - PocketBase provides a complete backend with REST API, real-time subscriptions, and admin UI
- **Free hosting** - Both Vercel and Fly.io offer generous free tiers
- **Fast development** - Hot reload for both frontend and backend during development
- **Production-ready** - Includes security best practices, TypeScript, and proper error handling

## Tech Stack

**Frontend Options:**
- **SvelteKit**: SvelteKit 2 with Svelte 5, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS 4
- **Next.js**: Next.js 15 with React 19, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS 4

## What is PocketKit?

PocketKit is a complete boilerplate for building full-stack applications with **SvelteKit** (frontend) and **PocketBase** (backend). It includes everything you need to start building:

- **Authentication ready** - Login, register, and session management configured
- **Free deployment** - Frontend on Vercel, backend on Fly.io
- **Automatic deployment** - Push to GitHub and deploy automatically
- **Local development** - Single command to run both frontend and backend
- **TypeScript** - Fully typed with SvelteKit and PocketBase SDKs

## Quick Start

<CardGrid stagger>
	<Card title="Local Development" icon="laptop">
		Clone the repo and run `yarn dev` to start both the frontend and PocketBase backend locally.

## Why PocketKit?

Building full-stack apps requires setting up authentication, databases, deployment pipelines, and more. PocketKit handles all of this so you can focus on building your product:

- **No backend code needed** - PocketBase provides a complete backend with REST API, real-time subscriptions, and admin UI
- **Free hosting** - Both Vercel and Fly.io offer generous free tiers
- **Fast development** - Hot reload for both frontend and backend during development
- **Production-ready** - Includes security best practices, TypeScript, and proper error handling

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: SvelteKit 2 with Svelte 5, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: PocketBase (Go-based backend with SQLite)
- **Deployment**: Vercel (frontend) + Fly.io (backend)
- **Database**: SQLite (managed by PocketBase)
